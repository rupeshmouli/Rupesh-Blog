HTML &amp; CSS

This website is about my learning phases of the HTML and CSS.

# My Journey begins like this:

I'm intrested in coding but didn't spend enough time to mould my career in the path I loved.

I have thoughts of working as developer for one of the Major companies around the nice colleauges to gain good amount of experience.

Today is 28/9/2023 and my thoughts are not fullfilled till now, due to me because of not taking my carrer seriously.

Today I again started as a fresh without breaking a day and become a Developer in 3 months of time.

Let's see what heppens on day to day basis. Will I stop here or move formward.
